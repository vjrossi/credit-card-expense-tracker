### Gives a quick breakdown by category, of your bank statement. Does not store any data, even in local storage.

Download a QIF formatted bank statement and drag-drop it onto the app. Transaction categories are relevant to Australia,
because company/store names are used for this purpose.

- The app attempts to recognise recurring transactions
- Hover over a pie slice to see total debits for that category
- Click on a pie slice to see transactions for that category
- Click on a category colour in the legend to toggle in/out that category
- Hover over the timeline to see total spending amounts for certain days; click for transaction details.
